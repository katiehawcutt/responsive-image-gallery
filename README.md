_This is another JavaScript 30 project and as usual I made it my own by changing some of the design inclduing the images, text and font. I think the ideas I've learnt doing this would work really well on a website so I'm looking forward to putting them to use again!_

### Main Learning Points:

- I used toggle for the first time to change between class lists.

- I used eventListeners to listen for 'click' and 'transitionend'.

- It was a good recap on CSS selectors and flex box.
